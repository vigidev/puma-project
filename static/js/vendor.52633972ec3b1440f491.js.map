MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker.

Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer.

It is based on the\n * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n */\n\n/**\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @name ClusterIconStyle\n * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.
